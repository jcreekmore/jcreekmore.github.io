title: About
---

My name is Jonathan Creekmore and I have been a software developer for many,
many years now. My first computer was a Tandy 1000 (with a RAM expansion card!),
but I did not start programming until several years later when I got my hands on
an IBM PS/1. I cut my teeth on QBasic, Debug, and a free version of Turbo C that
came with a book. The fun bit with that Turbo C compiler is that it only allowed
programs to run from within the IDE, so I figured out what code it was generating
to do the check and wrote a small program that modified the generated binaries to
disable the check.

From there, I continued on with C and finally migrated to C++ in college. However,
college exposed me to fun other languages that I became obsessed with. I explored
Lisp and Forth, eventually hacking together small versions of both languages.
May day job, though was in C/C++ so I had to keep my love of alternative languages
isolated to nights and weekends. Then, I discovered Haskell and strong type systems.
Now, my obsession left Lisp and Forth behind and I started learning everything I could
about Haskell and its ecosystem (and all of the mathematics behind its type stack).
I am still a systems programmer, though, so Haskell was not a good fit. Thus, I have
been migrating as much systems programming away from C/C++ and towards Rust, since it
has a strong type system much like Haskell's.
