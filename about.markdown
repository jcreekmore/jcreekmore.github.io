title: About

Technological Musings is meant to be my thoughts about anything technical. Since
I am a software engineer by trade, I expect that most of the content will be
software related. I am interested in programming languages, strong type systems,
and systems programming so those will probably be common topics. Also, I am
interested in autonomous vehicles and renewable energy, so from time to time
there might be articles talking about those topics.
