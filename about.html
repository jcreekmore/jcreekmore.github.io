							<p>My name is Jonathan Creekmore and I have been a software developer for many, many years now. My first computer was a Tandy 1000 (with a RAM expansion card!), but I did not start programming until several years later when I got my hands on an IBM PS/1. I cut my teeth on QBasic, Debug, and a free version of Turbo C that came with a book. The fun bit with that Turbo C compiler is that it only allowed programs to run from within the IDE, so I figured out what code it was generating to do the check and wrote a small program that modified the generated binaries to disable the check.</p>
<p>From there, I continued on with C and finally migrated to C++ in college. However, college exposed me to fun other languages that I became obsessed with. I explored Lisp and Forth, eventually hacking together small versions of both languages. May day job, though was in C/C++ so I had to keep my love of alternative languages isolated to nights and weekends. Then, I discovered Haskell and strong type systems. Now, my obsession left Lisp and Forth behind and I started learning everything I could about Haskell and its ecosystem (and all of the mathematics behind its type stack). I am still a systems programmer, though, so Haskell was not a good fit. Thus, I have been migrating as much systems programming away from C/C++ and towards Rust, since it has a strong type system much like Haskellâ€™s.</p>
